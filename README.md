# Play Abzû

Abzû is an adventure and exploration video game that immerses players in a vibrant underwater world filled with life, where the serenity of the ocean contrasts with the beauty of its landscapes. In this game, players take on the role of a diver who, as they dive into these depths, have the opportunity to swim freely and fluidly, experiencing the sensation of freedom and tranquility that the vast marine world offers.

# Music

The music has been designed with soft and joyful melodies, inspiring a sense of calm and wonder, perfectly aligning with the gameplay. This musical approach not only accents the tranquil exploration but also helps evoke deep emotions in players, allowing them to immerse themselves even further in the journey and the beauty of the ocean.
